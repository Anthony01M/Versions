# This will show in the join/leave event, e.g: Anthony has joined MyServer // Anthony has left MyServer.
#
# 2) Will work when chat/commands logs are enabled..
# This will show in the chat/commands logs, e.g: [myserver] [Time] Anthony has processed: /help // [myserver] [Time] Anthony » hello!
#
# Please be aware that if you change this to make it all lower case ( without caps ) and unique, e.g: sws-01 (skywars solo 01), sws-02 (skywars solo 02).
# Do not make the servername equals to another one, it will, not only potentially store it into your db and when logging a player name show
# the two servers at the same time but also could lead to multiple issues that I will not be taken responsible of.
