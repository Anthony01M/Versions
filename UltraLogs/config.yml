server:
  # Your Server Name, preferred game mode name, e.g: lobby, survival, etc.
  # Do not use Color Chat, they do not work as it's stored in the database for you to know.
  # This allowed bungee cord integration, everything is worked as you're running a network from when
  # the plugin was originally coded.
  #
  # 1) Will work if join/leave event are enabled..
  # This will show in the join/leave event, e.g: Anthony has joined MyServer // Anthony has left MyServer.
  #
  # 2) Will work when chat/commands logs are enabled..
  # This will show in the chat/commands logs, e.g: [myserver] [Time] Anthony has processed: /help // [myserver] [Time] Anthony » hello!
  #
  # Please be aware that if you change this to make it all lower case ( without caps ) and unique, e.g: sws-01 (skywars solo 01), sws-02 (skywars solo 02).
  # Do not make the servername equals to another one, it will, not only potentially store it into your db and when logging a player name show
  # the two servers at the same time but also could lead to multiple issues that I will not be taken responsible of.
  name: 'myserver'
  # Only enable this if you have bungee-cord / proxy
  # Do not enable it if you do not have a cross-server platform, it's really not recommended
  # This solves issues regarding bungee-cord cross-server issues, just in case your player left to
  # a server where the cache almost got added to the database so it doesn't actually show you for example
  # survival logs before the lobby logs.
  proxy: false
  # Between these 2 ( 4 possibilities ) options, please select your server's actual mode
  # premium / online - means your server is only for paid minecraft accounts ( recommended )
  # cracked / offline - means your server is at risk and accepts non paid minecraft accounts ( not recommended )
  # Please be aware that we do not officially provide support for offline mode.
  # Please avoid using offline mode at all times, it's not safe.
  # We'd like to confirm that this system is based on what you put, don't complain to us if you use
  # offline mode and put it as premium and suddenly errors occur.
  # This is made as a better system, instead of using the same method Essentials use and make it not that
  # well optimized, we're providing you the chance to decide yourself.
  # anything other than premium / online / cracked / offline will lead to the plugin to not work.
  # A basic explanation:
  # Online = we use UUID, more efficient.
  # Offline = we use player name, not efficient.
  # In both modes, the player name, player uuid, the event and the messages are stored.

  # A lot player base, I recommend the following:
  # Also it depends on your join, leave, chat, commands, etc.
  # So these might be higher or lower something, those are just recommendations

# Please and I actually beg you, don't put a realistic number cause it will just go back to
